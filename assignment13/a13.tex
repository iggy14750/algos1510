    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item Create a recursive solution to the problem.
            Let $i$ be an index into the $T$ sequence, and likewise for $j$ and $P$.
            \begin{lstlisting}[escapeinside={(*}{*)}]
function MAWS(i, j)
    if j == 0 then return 0 // End of P; success!
    if i == 0 then return failure // Reached the end of T without covering all of P

    if (*$t_i$*) == (*$p_j$*) then
        return max(
            MAWS(i - 1, j), // Exclude (*$t_i$*)
            MAWS(i - 1, j - 1) + (*$c_i$*)) // Include (*$t_i$*)
    else
        return MAWS(i - 1, j) // Exclude by default.
            \end{lstlisting}
        \item Give a dynamic programming algorithm based on enumerating the subsequences of $T$ and using pruning.
            Consider the typical subset enumeration tree over the elements of $T$.
            For this tree, we have the following pruning rule:
            \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
                \item When considering two nodes on the same level with the same length subsequence, choose the more expensive one.
            \end{enumerate}

            With this, we get the following code.
            \begin{lstlisting}[escapeinside={(*}{*)}]
let A[i, j] = an n+1(*$\times$*)k+1 matrix which represents the cost of
    the highest-valued subsequence of (*$t_1,\dots,t_i$*) with length j.
A[0, 0] = 0

for i = 1 to n do
    for j = 1 to k do
        if A[i-1, j] is defined then
            A[i, j] = max(A[i-1, j], A[i, j]) // Leave out (*$t_i$*)
            if (*$t_i$*) == (*$p_j$*) then
                A[i, j+1] = max(A[i, j+1], A[i-1, j] + (*$c_i$*)) // Include (*$t_i$*)

output A[n, k] // If no such sequence exists, then output is undefined, as per problem.
            \end{lstlisting}
            \pagebreak

        \item Give a dynamic programming algorithm based on enumerating the subsequences of $P$ and using pruning.
            In enumerating the subsequences of $P$, we have to recognize that a valid solution only occurs if all elements are present. So at each level we simply need to consider possible subsequences of $T$ that continue matching with the next element of $P$. This results in the following outline:

            \begin{lstlisting}[escapeinside={(*}{*)}]
let A[i, j] = a k+1(*$\times$*)n+1 matrix which represents the cost of
    the matching subsequence of (*$T$ \textit{ending} at $t_j$*) which
    matches from (*$p_1\dots p_i$*), if such subsequence exists

// first initialize the top row for any values in T that match (*$p_1$*)
for r = 1 to n do
    if (*$p_1 == t_r$*) then
        A[1][r] = (*$c_r$*) //each 1-item sequence that matches (*$p_1$*)

// now fill in the rest if (or as) they continue matching
for i = 2 to k do
    for j = p to n do
        if (*$p_i == t_j$*) then
            if A[i-1][j-1] is defined then //check if matched previously
                A[i][j] = max(A[i][j], A[i-1][j-1] + (*$c_j$*))

output (*$\displaystyle\max_{1 \leq l \leq n}$*) A[k, l]
            \end{lstlisting}

    As you can see, our pruning rule is to get rid of any node that has ceased matching with the set $P$ and retain only those subsequences at any given level which have matched for all previous levels and items in $T$.
    \end{enumerate}

    \prob{22}
    Given a tree which at each node, branches to buy a Bahn card for each trip or not, we can develop the following pruning rules.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If there is a Bahn card active at a particular node, then we don't need to buy a new one.
        \item Only the last Bahn card purchased needs to be taken into account when making this decision.
        \item We can buy at most $n$ Bahn cards, one for each trip.
        \item Given two nodes on the same level which have the same number of discounted days left, then choose the one with the least overall cost.
    \end{enumerate}

    \begin{lstlisting}[escapeinside={(*}{*)}]
let A[i, j] = an n+1(*$\times$*)n+1 matrix with the cost of the least expensive
    way to travel to locations (*$T_1,\dots,T_i$*) given that the last Bahn card
    was purchased for trip j.
A[0, 0] = 0

function activeBahnCard(i, j)
    if j == 0 then return False
    return (*$d_i$*) - (*$d_j \leq $*) L

for i = 1 to n do
    for j = 0 to n do
        if A[i-1, j] is defined then
            if activeBahnCard(i, j) then
                // Not considering buying a new Bahn card.
                A[i, j] = min(A[i, j], A[i-1, j] + (*$\frac{1}{2}f_i$*))
            else
                A[i, j] = min(A[i, j], A[i-1, j] + (*$f_i$*)) // Not buying a new Bahn card
                A[i, i] = min(A[i, j], A[i-1, j] + B + (*$\frac{1}{2}f_i$*)) // Here we are buying a new one.
output (*$\displaystyle\min_{0 \leq j \leq n}$*) A[n, j]
    \end{lstlisting}

This algorithm runs in $O(n^2)$ time since the array is n x n, independent of $B$ or $L$.
