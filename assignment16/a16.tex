    \prob{24}
    Consider the tree: at each level we are deciding whether to include some element.
    As this tree is $n$ levels deep, it has $2^n$ leaves.
    This tree represents the decision of what to include on some side of the scale, say the left side for discussion.
    We can infer the content of the right side to be $\{B_1, \dots, B_i\} - L$ at some level $i$ if $L$ is the subset on the left side of the scale.

    We can drastically reduce the size of this tree by observing the following rule:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If two feasible solutions are on the same level, 
        and if the weight of the left side of one is the same as either side of the other, 
        then one can prune one of them arbitrarily.
    \end{enumerate}
    We can include this rule because:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*)]
        \item Given the level, and weight of one side, we can calculate the weight of the other.
        \item If both solutions have the same pair of weights, and a global solution can be built off of one of them,
            then one can also be built off of the other. 
            [The rest of the solution is disjoint from these two partial solutions].
    \end{enumerate}
    Please note that this can be done with two uses of the scale.
    The other solution can be reconstructed from some stored information, 
    and the scale can be used to tell us if these two subsets are of equal weight.
    %Now we're going to consider the following code

    \begin{lstlisting}
subset A[n (*$\times$*) nL] // A[i, *] holds a list of subsets of the first i boxes which are feasible
    // solutions.  This list has a length of nL because at maximum, n elements can be on
    // one side of the scale, each with L weight. Although we do not know the weight of 
    // a collection of boxes directly, there will be at most nL distinct weights,
    // so this can store them all.
A[0, 0] = (*$\emptyset$*)
for i = 0 to n do
    for j = 0 to nL do
        if A[i, j] is defined then
            // include (*$B_{i+1}$*) on the left scale.
            t = A[i, j] (*$\cup$*) (*$\{B_{i+1}\}$*)
            for k = 0 to nL do
                if A[i+1, k] is undefined then
                    A[i+1, k] = t // This solution shape has not been seen.
                if A[i+1, k] == t then // Weigh against left side of existing solution.
                    break // There is already a solution of this shape.
                if (*$\{B_1,\dots,B_{i+1}\}$*) - A[i+1, k] == t then // Weigh against right side.
                    break
            // Do not include (*$B_{i+1}$*), put it on the right side.
            for k = 0 to nL do
                if A[i+1, k] is undefined then
                    A[i+1, k] = A[i, j]
                if A[i+1, k] == A[i, j] or (*$\{B_1,\dots,B_{i+1}\}$*) - A[i+1, k] == A[i, j] then
                    break
    \end{lstlisting}
As we can see, we're looking at something like $O(n(nL)^2) = O(n^3L^2)$
