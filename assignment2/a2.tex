    \section*{Problem 1}
    Consider the following problem:
    
    INPUT: A set $S = \{(x_i, y_i)\ |\ 1 \leq i \leq n\}$ of intervals over the real line.
    
    OUTPUT: A maximum cardinality subset $S$ of $S$ such that no pair of intervals in $S$ overlap.
        
    Consider the following algorithm:
    
    \begin{lstlisting}
    Repeat until S is empty:
        1. Select the interval I that overlaps the least number of other intervals.
        2. Add I to final solution set S.
        3. Remove all intervals from S that overlap with I.
    \end{lstlisting}

    Prove or disprove that this algorithm solves the problem.\\
    
    \soln Either there is an interval in $Opt$ which does not overlap any interval in $A(I)$, in which case contradiction OR

    There are intervals $o \in Opt$ that overlap intervals $a \in A(I)$ in one of the following ways:
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The differing interval $o \in Opt$ overlapped with fewer other intervals than the interval $a \in A(I)$, which is a contradiction.
        \item The differing interval o in OPT overlapped with more other intervals than the interval a in A(I), in which case.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Some intervals $o \in Opt$ overlapped other intervals $FRED$ which were not overlapped by the choice $a \in A(I)$, in which case $A$ could have chosen the least overlapping member of $FRED$ to be in $A(I)$, making an $Opt'$ with $FRED + a + FRED$ more similar to $A(I)$ than $Opt$.
            \item
        \end{enumerate}
        \item
    \end{enumerate}
    
    BETTER LAYOUT/ARGUMENT
    
    
    

    Region of difference (ROD) $\implies$ must be more intervals than $A(I)$ in that region (if there are fewer, then $A(I)$ has more disjoint intervals than $Opt$, contradicting optimality of $Opt$) (if the same, then $A(I)$ has the same cardinality as $Opt$, contradicting incorrectness of $A(I)$). If more, then:
    
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item There exists at least one interval in $Opt$ that is disjoint from all in $A(I) \implies$ contradiction ($A$ would've chosen it).
        
        \item There are interval(s) in ROD in $Opt$ that are have fewer overlaps than all the ROD intervals in $A(I) \implies $ contradiction ($A$ would've chosen them).
        So all intervals in ROD in $Opt$ must have at least as many overlaps as least overlapping interval in $A(I)$...
        
        \item Argument about number of overlaps... see following, or possibly by exchange would be easier.
        If the intervals in ROD in $Opt$ have fewer total overlaps than those in $A(I)$, then [INSERT NUMBER THEORY -- maybe pigeon-hole related?]
        One of them must have fewer overlaps than any in $A(I) \implies$ contradiction ($A$ would've chosen it)
        If ROD in $Opt$ has same number of total overlaps as in $A(I)$, then at least one of those intervals has less/equal overlaps as one in $A(I)$
        [triangle inequality?]
    \end{enumerate}
    
    
    \section*{Problem 2}
    
    Consider the following Interval Coloring Problem.\\
    INPUT:A set $S = \{(x_i, y_i)\ |\ 1 \leq i \leq n\}$ of intervals over the real line. Think of interval $(x_i, y_i)$ as being a request for a room for a class that meets from time $x_i$ to time $y_i$.\\
    OUTPUT: Find an assignment of classes to rooms that uses the fewest number of rooms.
    Note that every room request must be honored and that no two classes can use a room at the same
    time.
    
    \begin{enumerate}[label=\Alph*.]
        \item Consider the following iterative algorithm. Assign as many classes as possible to the first room (we can do this using the greedy algorithm discussed in class, and in the class notes), then assign as many classes as possible to the second room, then assign as many classes as possible to the third room, etc. Does this algorithm solve the Interval Coloring Problem? Justify your answer.
        
        \soln Consider the following set of intervals:
        
        \image{p2a_counterexample}
        
        Note that the optimal solution is to have $A,C$ in Room 1, and $B, D$ in Room 2.
        
        However, this algorithm outputs $A, D$ in Room 1, $B$ in Room 2, and $C$ in Room 3.
        
        First, it chooses $A$, eliminates $B$, chooses $D$, and then eliminates $C$. On the second pass, this algorithm chooses $B$, and eliminates $C$.
        Then on the third pass, only $C$ is left, and it is chosen.
        
        As this algorithm does not find the optimal solution, it does not solve this problem.
        
        \item Consider the following algorithm. Process the classes in increasing order of start times. Assume that you are processing class $C$. If there is a room $R$ such that $R$ has been assigned to an earlier class, and $C$ can be assigned to $R$ without overlapping previously assigned classes, then assign $C$ to $R$. Otherwise, put $C$ in a new room. Does this algorithm solve the Interval Coloring Problem?
        Justify your answer.
