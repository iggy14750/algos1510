Either there is an interval in OPT which does not overlap any interval in A(I), in which case contradiction
OR
There are intervals o in OPT that overlap intervals a in A(I) in one of the following ways:
    1. The differing interval o in OPT overlapped with fewer other intervals than the interval a in A(I), which is a contradiction
    2. The differing interval o in OPT overlapped with more other intervals than the interval a in A(I), in which case
        a. Some intervals o in OPT overlapped other intervals FRED which were not overlapped by the choice a in A(I), in which 
            case A could have chosen the least overlapping member of FRED to be in A(I), making an OPT' with FRED + a + FRED more similar to A(I)
            than OPT
        b. 
    3. 
    
    
    
    BETTER LAYOUT/ARGUMENT
    
Region of difference (ROD) --> must be more intervals than A(I) in that region 
    (if there are fewer, then A(I) has more disjoint intervals than OPT, contradicting optimality of OPT).
    (if the same, then A(I) has the same cardinality as OPT, contradicting incorrectness of A(I)).
    if more, then
        1. There exists at least one interval in OPT that is disjoint from all in A(I) --> contradiction (A would've chosen it)
        2. There are interval(s) in ROD in OPT that are have fewer overlaps than all the ROD intervals in A(I) --> contradiction (A would've chosen them)
            So all intervals in ROD in OPT must have at least as many overlaps as least overlapping interval in A(I)...
        3. Argument about number of overlaps... see following, or possibly by exchange would be easier
            If the intervals in ROD in OPT have fewer total overlaps than those in A(I), then [INSERT NUMBER THEORY -- maybe pigeon-hole related?]
            one of them must have fewer overlaps than any in A(I) --> contradiction (A would've chosen it)
            If ROD in OPT has same number of total overlaps as in A(I), then at least one of those intervals has less/equal overlaps as one in A(I)
            [triangle inequality?]
            
            If ROD in OPT has more total overlaps than in A(I).... something about eliminating more intervals????
