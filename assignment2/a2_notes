Either there is an interval in OPT which does not overlap any interval in A(I), in which case contradiction
OR
There are intervals o in OPT that overlap intervals a in A(I) in one of the following ways:
    1. The differing interval o in OPT overlapped with fewer other intervals than the interval a in A(I), which is a contradiction
    2. The differing interval o in OPT overlapped with more other intervals than the interval a in A(I), in which case
        a. Some intervals o in OPT overlapped other intervals FRED which were not overlapped by the choice a in A(I), in which 
            case A could have chosen the least overlapping member of FRED to be in A(I), making an OPT' with FRED + a + FRED more similar to A(I)
            than OPT
        b. 
    3. 
    
    
Region of difference (ROD) --> must be more intervals than A(I) in that region 
    (if there are fewer, then A(I) has more disjoint intervals than OPT, contradicting optimality of OPT).
    (if the same, then A(I) has the same cardinality as OPT, contradicting incorrectness of A(I)).
    if more, then
        1. There exists at least one interval in OPT that is disjoint from all in A(I) --> contradiction (A(I) would've chosen it)
        2a. There are interval(s) in ROD in OPT that are smaller than all the ROD intervals in A(I) --> contradiction (A(I) would've chosen them)
            So all intervals in ROD in OPT must be at least the same size as the smallest in A(I)...
