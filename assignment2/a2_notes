Region of difference (RoD) --> must be more intervals than A(I) in that region 
    (if there are fewer, then A(I) has more disjoint intervals than OPT, contradicting optimality of OPT).
    (if the same, then A(I) has the same cardinality as OPT, contradicting incorrectness of A(I)).
    if more, then
        1. There exists at least one interval in OPT that is disjoint from all in A(I) --> contradiction (A would've chosen it)
        2. There are interval(s) in RoD in OPT that are have fewer overlaps than all the RoD intervals in A(I) --> contradiction (A would've chosen them)
           So all intervals in RoD in OPT must have at least as many overlaps as least overlapping interval in A(I)...
        3. Because there are strictly more intervals in OPT than A(I) and each has \textbf{at least} the number of overlaps as the 
           min_overlaps\{A(I)\}, it follows that, within the RoD, the total set of intervals in OPT overlaps more than the total set of intervals in A(I).
            
           Because there are more overlaps in OPT than in A(I), there are fewer remaining intervals once those in OPT have been selected. In this
           case, there must be 0 remaining (else OPT would have selected more, contradicting our selection of OPT as optimal). Then because
           the selection of intervals in A(I) has overlapped (and hence eliminated) strictly fewer other intervals, there must be some nonzero
           number of intervals left. This contradicts algorithm A. If we include those leftover intervals in A(I), then it meets cardinality
           of OPT, once again contradicting the nonoptimality of A(I).
           
           If RoD in OPT has more total overlaps than in A(I).... something about eliminating more intervals????
