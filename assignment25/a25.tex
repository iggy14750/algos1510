    We can say that \reducible{Vertex Cover}{River Crossing} by the following reduction:
    \begin{lstlisting}
function VertexCover(G, k)
    return RiverCrossing(G, k)
    \end{lstlisting}
    \begin{proof}
        We must establish that a $k$-cover is possible iff a $k$-crossing is possible.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $k$-cover impossible $\implies$ $k$-crossing impossible.
            If this is the case, then we cannot make the first move.
            Attempting to take any subset of vertices without breaking up every edge means we have lost the game.
            
            \item $k$-cover possible $\implies$ $k$-crossing possible.
            \begin{lemma}
                If a graph $G$ has a $k$-cover, then all subgraphs of $G$ contain a $k$-cover.
            \end{lemma}
            
            This tells us that it is always possible to collect a subset of vertices so that either side of the river is edge-free.

            Thus, the only issue is whether we can complete the entire move.
            I am going to say here that large cliques are the hardest problem.
            That is, in the sense that all subproblems possible on some number of vertices are subproblems of the clique on those vertices.
            I want to show that even in these hardest of problems, having a $k$-cover available implies it is possible to find a $k$-crossing.

            So, let's say we have a $k+1$-clique to start out with.
            Well, then we move a $k$-clique over, leaving one lone vertex.
            But we can't leave this entire clique and go back, so we leave just one vertex, and carry our $k-1$-cover back.
            We then join back up with our vertex left on the left, invite him to our boat, and complete the challenge.

            This can be extended to support graphs which contain a $k+1$-clique as a proper subgraph but have a $k$-cover, by moving vertices outside of the clique one at a time, with our $k-1$ cover on board.

        \end{itemize}
    \end{proof}
    
    \prob{5}
    On an EREW PRAM with $n$ processors, we get the following algorithm for computing $n!$ in $O(lg(n))$ time:\\
    \begin{lstlisting}
        fact($k, n, p$)   // k is the starting value for our partial product
        if p == 1 then return 1
        else return fact($k, \frac{n+k}{2}, \frac{p}{2}$) $\times$ fact($\frac{n+k}{2}, n, \frac{p}{2}$)
    \end{lstlisting}
