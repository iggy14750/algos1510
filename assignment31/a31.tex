The task is to number the \textit{leaves} of the tree in-order, that is left to right. This is straightforward.
Once we create a list of the nodes via an Eulerian tour as stated in class (constant time), we simply perform the following function ('Smash') on the list.
Note that this function copies only the leaf-nodes from the list to an array of the same size as the list.
It then removes the empty space between the leaves in $O(lg(n))$ time by "smashing" recursively.
The result is an ordered list of leaves (which could be easily "numbered" by again performing parallel prefix).

\begin{lstlisting}
function Smash(list)
    array = new int[|list|]
    By parPrefix(list), we know the position of each node.
    parFor i = 1 to 3n do
        if list[i] is a leaf node then
            array[i] = list[i]
    function inner(A)
        if |A| == 1 then
            return (null, null)
        left_head, left_tail = inner(A[0...n/2])
        right_head, right_tail = inner(A[n/2...n])
        if right_head == null then
            return (left_head, left_tail)
        else if left_head == null then
            return (right_head, right_tail)
        Connect left_tail to right_head.
        return (left_head, right_tail)
    return inner(array)
\end{lstlisting}

Or, in a less precise, but perhaps more straight-forward style.

\begin{lstlisting}
function Smash(list)
    Each node finds its position in the list using linked list parPrefix
    Copy your element into an array at the position found before.
    If you are a node we want to get rid of, delete it from the array.
    Top-down recursion:
        On 1 element, return it as both head and tail of list.
        Otherwise, glue together the two lists and return that lists head and tail.
    Return that shit.
\end{lstlisting}

To find the balance factor of a given node, simply perform the node depth algorithm as given in class, with a few minor changes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item When the list is first created with the Eulerian tour, keep all three copies of a Node even if both children are not present. (Refer to the three instances of a Node as mere nodes). If a child is missing, simply skip it and point at the next node in the triplet (see image at the end for example).
  \item Then, when calculating depth with parallel prefix, give each processor one extra job (a scalar multiple on the amount of work overall): in another location, record the largest sum encountered between your node (in the triplet of three) and your sibling to the right (again in your three). This will give the max depth reached in that subtree of that Node.
  \item If you are the rightmost node in a Node, finally write the balance factor which is $(localMaxDepthLeft - depthOfNode) - (localMaxDepthRight - depthOfNode) = localMaxDepthLeft - localMaxDepthRight$. Done.
\end{itemize}

This is quite similar to the problem described in class, of reducing an expression tree of addition and subtraction operations.
The major difference lies in the addition of multiplication and division as operatations.
This seems to have no effect on the algorithm discussed in class, except when performing contractions on the tree.

When working with addition and subtraction, we knew that every edge function was of the form $\pm x + c$ ($c \in \R$), and that combining two of these functions with either of our operations would leave the result of the same form.
That is, we knew that our functions were closed under the relevant operations.

The problem, then, is with multiplication.
When multiplying two functions of this form, we will have a quadratic function.
And that, in general, the size of these functions can then, in the worst case, grow to a degree linear in $n$.
So that is clearly unacceptable.

However, this problem will only arise on multiplication operations of two non-leaf children.
But, as discussed in class, reducing in such a situation doesn't make sense anyway.
For multiplication, this decision avoids the production of arbitrarily-growing polynomials.

In the case that one or both children are leaves, the actual value can be calculated in constant time.
That is, suppose we chose to reduce a node with two children.
One was a non-leaf, with the function $f(x)$ on the edge to it.
The other was a leaf with a value $k$, and a function $g(x)$ on the edge to it.
Then $g(k)$ can be calculated in constant time, and $g(k)*f(x)$ will still be a linear polynomial
(what we see here is that now our functions are general linear formulae, but this does not affect our algorithm or its runtime).

So, in this way, we can apply the exact same algorithm from class to success here.

\prob{24}
This is again a modification of the arithmetic trees in class.
In this case, we are also concerned with whether the Boolean functions on these edges will grow to unreasonable size.
It is not immediately obvious in this case that we can avoid this.
We might expect that some nasty expression like $\lnot(1 \land ((\lnot 0 \land x ) \lor 1))$ might appear.

Notice, however, that all edge functions are functions of one variable.
In Boolean logic, this constrains us to only 4 functions: 1, 0, identity, and inversion.
Moreover, they can be combined in constant time.
Let $f: \mathbb{B} \to \mathbb{B}$ be one of those Boolean function.

% I imagine there's a better table for this
\begin{align*}
    f \lor 1 &= 1\\
    f \lor 0 &= f\\
    f \land 1 &= f\\
    f \land 0 &= 0\\
    \lnot 1 &= 0\\
    \lnot 0 &= 1\\
    \lnot x &= \lnot x\\
    \lnot (\lnot x) &= x
\end{align*}

Note that again, at least one the arguments into the reductions are constant.
In the case of \verb|not|, the argument is a function, but one such function can be reduced in constant time, as well.

Therefore, all other aspects of our in-class algorithm are unchanged, meaning that we can use it here with this modification with success.
