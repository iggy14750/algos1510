Ya got 2 jobs ya got x and y, we're lookin' at the last unit of x (from SRPT), which is at time t.
What we care about is the first time the end of a job differs from OPT to SRPT.


So in SRPT, job x completes at time unit t. In OPT, job y is run instead (for some reason) during that unit.
x must come at a later time in OPT and thus is available for OPT' to switch back.

So OPT' is OPT except this final unit of x is swapped back into time t and the y-unit is put where x was in OPT.
Now, y must have more time left than x (ie more than 1 unit left), otherwise we are done. So moving x back decreases x's time by >1 but increases
y's time by at most 1.

Also counterexample for SJF is (3,6) and (0,8) or (2,2) and (0,3).
