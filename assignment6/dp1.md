a. Let's use the input of 5 for example.  This means T(5) = T(1)T(0) + sum_from_2_to_4(T(i)T(i-1)) which simplifies to T(1)T(0) + T(2)T(1) + T(3)T(2) + T(4)T(3).  This produces T(1)T(0) + T(1)T(0) + T(2)T(1) + T(1)T(0) + T(3)T(2) + T(2)T(1) + T(1)T(0).  This simplifies to T(1)T(0) + T(1)T(0) + T(1)T(0) + T(1)T(0) + T(2)T(1) + T(1)T(0) + T(1)T(0) + T(1)T(0).  This simplifies to T(1)T(0) + T(1)T(0) + T(1)T(0) + T(1)T(0) + T(1)T(0) + T(1)T(0) + T(1)T(0) + T(1)T(0).  This is 8 multiplications and 7 additions for a total of 15 arithmetic operations.  If 6 were the input, we would add the sum(i=1, 5) onto that total, which is exactly what we computed.  This means just by increasing the input value by 1, we have doubled our number of operations.  Then if the input was 7, we would add the sum(i=1, 6), doubling the number of arithmetic operations that was performed when we had input 6.  Obviously, over time, we double the number of operations for every increment of the input.
