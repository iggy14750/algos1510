Let G = {G_1, G_2, G_3, ..., G_n} be the set of goods, and G_H, G_W be the goods assigned to the husband and wife, respectively.

Then we consider the algorithm:

```
Repeat until G is empty:
    W and H take turns choosing the good they have valued the highest, which is still part of G.
    They remove this good from G and place it in their own collections.
```
