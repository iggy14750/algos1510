\prob{2}
Give a polynomial time algorithm that takes three strings, A, B and C, as input, and returns the longest sequence S that is a subsequence of A, B, and C.

\begin{thm}
The following algorithm, as described, provides a polynomial time $(O(n^3))$ solution to the LCS problem with 3 strings.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
    Very similarly to the Longest Common Subsequence problem we did in class, we can use a three-dimensional array to find the longest common subsequence of three different strings in polynomial time, specifically $n^3$ time. If strings A, B, and C have lengths a, b, and c respectively, then we make a matrix $LCS[a+1][b+1][c+1]$ and perform the following iterative process by way of a triple for-loop:
    
    \begin{lstlisting}

        int LCS[a+1][b+1][c+1]
        set LCS[i][0][0] = 0
        set LCS[0][j][0] = 0
        set LCS[0][0][k] = 0
        
        for i=1,a do:
            for j=0,b do:
                for k=0,c do:
                    if A[i] == B[j] == C[k]
                        then LCS[i][j][k] = LCS[i-1][j-1][k-1] + 1 \\ or + C[k] if this is a string matrix
                    else
                        LCS[i][j][k] = max{LCS[i-1][j][k], LCS[i][j-1][k], LCS[i][j][k-1]}
                    
        return LCS[a][b][c]
        
    \end{lstlisting}
    
    As we can plainly see, the three for-loops run according to the length of the words and provide a nice polynomial time process for finding the LCS. Of course, this process can be generalized to work for arbitrary number of words.

\end{proof}
