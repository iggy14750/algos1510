OK, so we're going to assume that these choices are made beginning from the slowest walker, and moving to faster ones.

There seem to be 2 ways to move walkers:
  1. We can move 1 at a time.
    - in which case, we run someone down with the fastest runner available, and return that runner to get back to work.
  2. We can move in pairs.
    - in which case, we first move the fastest 2 runners out to the far side, bring the fastest back, move the 2 slowest out together, and bring the second fastest back [he was put out there to bring the torch back].

I would REALLY like to know if I'm missing any movement strategies.


Lemma: It is always optimal to send the fastest runner on the far side back with the torch.

Proof: If anyone else went, then not only would their time back be longer, but whoever brings the torch back has to eventually cross again (at least one more time). Choosing a slower runner could leave this time unchanged, or increase it, but in no case does sending the torch back with a slower runner result in a more optimal outcome. QED

Lemma: Any optimal move of n walker will result in 2n-3 trips arcross the bridge.

Proof: Consider there are only two walkers on the near side of the bridge.
Then they can just cross. 2*2 - 3 = 4-3 = 1.

Now assume the lemma holds for all number of walkers less than n.
To move a single walker across the bridge, he must cross, and someone else must also cross back to return the torch to the others.

Then we are left with n-1 walkers, which we know requires 2(n-1) - 3 = 2n - 5 bridge crossings.
But because we had the 2 crossings from before, the overall number of crossings for the company was 2n - 5 + 2 = 2n - 3 crossings. QED



The algorithm is the following:

```
Repeat until the near side of the bridge is empty:
    Choose between pair cross and individual cross.
    Excecute the crossing, but not both individual crossings.
    S_2 might be better in a pair with S_3.
```
