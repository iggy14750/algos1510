__Give a polynomial time algorithm that takes three strings, A, B and C, as input, and returns the longest sequence S that is a subsequence of A, B, and C.__

Very similarly to the Longest Common Subsequence problem we did in class, we can use a three-dimensional array to find the longest common subsequence of three different strings in polynomial time, specifically n^3 time. If strings A, B, and C have lengths a, b, and c respectively, then we make a matrix LCS[a+1][b+1][c+1] and perform the following iterative process by way of a triple for-loop:

int LCS[a+1][b+1][c+1]
set LCS[i][0][0] = 0
set LCS[0][j][0] = 0
set LCS[0][0][k] = 0

for i=1,a do:
    for j=0,b do:
        for k=0,c do:
            if A[i] == B[j] == C[k]
                then LCS[i][j][k] = LCS[i-1][j-1][k-1] + 1 \\ or + C[k] if this is a string matrix
            else
                LCS[i][j][k] = max{LCS[i-1][j][k], LCS[i][j-1][k], LCS[i][j][k-1]}
            
return LCS[a][b][c]

As we can plainly see, the three for-loops run according to the length of the words and provide a nice polynomial time process for finding the LCS. Of course, this process can be generalized to work for arbitrary number of words.
