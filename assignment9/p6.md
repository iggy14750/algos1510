Define a neighbor chord to be a chord that, when drawn through a polygon, creates a triangle.

Lemma: All triangulations of a polygon include at least one neighbor chord.

Proof: ??? [See Jon]

Lemma: Each triangulation can be decomposed into a series of neighbor chords of sub-polygons.

Proof: Take some feasible triangulation.
By the previous lemma, it contains a neighbor chord.
Remove the vertex of its triangle not on the chord, and repeat with the new sub-polygon.

So, we can consider all triangles by first starting with all neighbor chords, and the sub-polygon created therefrom.

```
function minCuts(P)
    let n = order(P)
    if n = 3 then
        return 0
    else
        return min_{x in P} (distance(left(x), right(x)) + minCuts(P - x))
end
```


And iteratively:
```
for i = 3 to n do
    for all i-gons Q in P do
        if i == 3 then
            minCuts[Q] = 0
        else
            minCuts[Q] = min_{x in Q}(dist(left(x), right(x)) + minCuts[Q-x])
```
