\textbf{GREEDY ALGORITHMS}
$Max Num Non-overlapping Intervals$
\begin{itemize}
  \item Exchange at the interval where Opt(I) and A(I) first disagree.
  \item Then Opt'(I) doesn't overlap on the left, since they agree to that point.
  \item Nor on the right, since the A(I) interval ends first.
  \item Opt'(I) has just as many intervals, so still optimal.
\end{itemize}

$Max Num Non-overlapping Intervals$\\
A = pick the interval that overlaps the least number of other intervals\\
(this is wrong, see pic for counterexample)


$Earliest Deadline First$\\
EDF = pick as the next job the one whose deadline is earliest
\begin{itemize}\tightlist
  \item At some point Opt runs job $j$ and EDF runs job $i$.
  \item Opt' = Opt except running $i$ at that point.
  \item 3 things:
  \item \begin{itemize}\tightlist
    \item Length of time (obviously fine)
    \item Release time -- EDF ran $i$ at that time (so fine)
    \item Deadlines -- $j$ is not past deadline in Opt' since (by EDF) $i$ ends first, and (by Opt) that is at least 1 unit after when Opt runs $i$
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

$Huffman's Algorithm$


$Interval Coloring Problem, pt 1$
Find an assignment of classes to rooms that uses the fewest number of rooms.\\
A = Assign as many as possible to 1st room (via the 'smallest rightpoint first' algorithm), then as many as possible to 2nd room, etc.

$Interval Coloring Problem, pt 2$
Find an assignment of classes to rooms that uses the fewest number of rooms.\\
Process in increasing order of start times. Take class $C$. If $\exists$ room $R$ \st $C$ can be assigned to $R$ without overlapping previously assigned classes, then assign $C$ to $R$. Otherwise, put $C$ in a new room.
\begin{itemize}\tightlist
  \item Lemma: In any collection of intervals, there exist points which have the maximum number of intervals, say $n$, intersecting at the same time. This means that there is no way to fit these classes with any fewer than n rooms.
  \item Now consider a course. Each room is chosen by start time, so all previous rooms are already placed.
	This course overlaps with some ($n$) already placed, and some ($m$) not yet placed.
	\item Placing this course will require $n+1$ rooms to be optimal, by the lemma above.
	\item Now, because the other n have been placed, this course conflicts with them all, and thus requires exactly $n+1$ rooms. This process repeats for each course.
\end{itemize}


$Skiers and Skis$
a) Consider 4s, 8s, 7p, 12p
b) Persons and skis are ordered. In Opt the skis are swapped for some person $i$ and some person $m$. Then we show Opt is no better than Opt'. 4 elements to order, 6 cases (absolute value).
