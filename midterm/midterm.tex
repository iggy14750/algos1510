$Max Num Non-overlapping Intervals$
\begin{itemize}
  \item Exchange at the interval where Opt(I) and A(I) first disagree.
  \item Then Opt'(I) doesn't overlap on the left, since they agree to that point.
  \item Nor on the right, since the A(I) interval ends first.
  \item Opt'(I) has just as many intervals, so still optimal.
\end{itemize}

$Earliest Deadline First$\\
EDF = pick as the next job the one whose deadline is earliest
\begin{itemize}\tightlist
  \item At some point Opt runs job $j$ and EDF runs job $i$.
  \item Opt' = Opt except running $i$ at that point.
  \item 3 things:
  \item \begin{itemize}\tightlist
    \item Length of time (obviously fine)
    \item Release time -- EDF ran $i$ at that time (so fine)
    \item Deadlines -- $j$ is not past deadline in Opt' since (by EDF) $i$ ends first, and (by Opt) that is at least 1 unit after when Opt runs $i$
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
